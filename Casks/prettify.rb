# Homebrew Cask template for Prettify (macOS desktop app).
#
# This is the SOURCE OF TRUTH. CI (release.yml -> bump-homebrew) fills in the
# version and the two per-arch SHA-256 placeholders, then writes the result to
# Casks/prettify.rb in the public tap repo (alexitaylor/homebrew-tap).
# (The placeholder tokens are intentionally not spelled out in this comment so
# the sed substitution can't mangle it.)
#
# Users install with:
#   brew install --cask alexitaylor/tap/prettify
#
# The app is signed + notarized, so it installs without quarantine prompts.
